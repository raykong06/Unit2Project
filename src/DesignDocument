LinearEquation class

use DecimalFormat to round to certain places and truncate where needed (aesthetics)
- df will round to two decimal places "0.00"
- dft will truncate trailing zeros if the double values do not have a decimal

Instance Variables:
(all to be initialized, not yet assigned to a value)
- private int x1 = x value of first input coordinate
- private int y1 = y value of first input coordinate
- private int x2 = x value of second input coordinate
- private int y2 = y value of second input coordinate
- private int rise
- private int run
- private double slope
- private double inverse
- private double yIntercept
- private String equation
- private double distance
- private double x3 = x value of third point input coordinate
- private double y3 = calculated value of third y point

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
- assign all parameters to a private variable to be used later

Methods
public double SlopeCalculator()
- will take the y2 value and subtract y1 value from it, assign it to private variable rise
- will take the x2 value and subtract the x1 value from it, assign to private variable run
- will divide rise by run, assign to private slope variable
- check to see if slope is a whole number/int, if so then use dft, if no then df
- return slope value

public double YIntercept()
- will take the slope value and multiply it by x1 value, then multiply by -1, assign value to variable inverse
 ^ (takes the inverse to calculate and "isolate" the y-intercept in an equation)
- will take the inverse and add it to the y1 value
- check to see if yintercept is a whole number/int, if so then use dft, if no then df
- return yIntercept value

public String SlopeInterceptForm()
- will put all the values necessary in correct positions of a slope-intercept form equation
- returns a String equation in y=mx+b format

public double Distance()
- assigns distance formula equation to distance variable
- will use Math.sqrt, and manually multiply (i * i) to square values
- check to see if distance is a whole number/int, if so then use dft, if no then df
- returns distance value

public void SolvedCoord()
- calculate y-value by using y = mx + b formula
- multiply x3 by slope then adds the y-intercept value
- PRINTS the calculated point (x3, y3)

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this
instance including:
- First pair of coordinates: (x1, y1)
- Second pair of coordinates: (x2, y2)
- Slope of line: private variable slope
- Y-intercept
- Slope intercept form equation
- Distance between points

EquationRunner class

Requires Scanner class to accept user input
s Scanner

Instance variables:
- int x1 = x value of first input coordinate
- int y1 = y value of first input coordinate
- int x2 = x value of second input coordinate
- int y2 = y value of second input coordinate

- String coord1
- String coord2

(to be converted into integers later)
- String stringX1
- String stringY1
- String stringX2
- String stringY2

- int indexComma1 = comma index in first coord
- int indexComma2 = comma index in second coord

- int lengthCoord1 = length of coord 1
- int lengthCoord2 = length of coord 2

- double x3 = value of x-value input

Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
(use s.nextString to turn
Step 3: parse out x1 value by finding index of comma in first coord point, assign to indexComma1
Step 4: take substring by taking index 1 to indexComma1, assign to stringX1
Step 5: convert string to integer using Integer.parseInt(stringX1), assign to int x1
Step 6: parse out y1 value by getting length of coord 1,
